# Simple-Temp-Converter

Week 8 Lab - CST8285 Winter 2019 @ Algonquin College

Objectives
Upon completing this lab, you should be able to:

Start the Apache server in XAMPP/MAMPP/etc, and add files to the server's web directory
Create PHP files
Declare PHP variables and functions
Understand PHP data types
Determine PHP variable types
Accept and process data from the browser using the GET(form) and POST(form) methods

In this task, you will be creating a temperature converter. All programming must be done in PHP (no JavaScript). The requirements are:

The temperature must be accepted from a text box, in an HTML form.
The user must be given the option to convert the value to fahrenheit or celsius. (Hint: Use radio buttons or a dropdown box.)
Error checking must be done to ensure that the user has entered a number. If they did not, they should be notified of the error, use a loop to control the user input
If the user entered a number, the number should now be converted to the requested temperature unit. The conversion logic should be programmed in a function. The function should take two parameters: the temperature to be converted, and the unit the temperature is to be converted to. Once complete, the function should return the converted temperature.
Finally, display the original temperature and the converted temperature to the user.
